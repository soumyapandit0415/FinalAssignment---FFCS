In a news application, sections or categories like _"World," "Business," "Health," "Sports,"_ and _"Tech"_ represent different thematic areas or topics of news content. 

_**Here's a brief description of each section:**_

**World**: The "All" section typically provides a comprehensive overview of news from various categories. It's often the default landing page where users can find a mix of top stories and recent news articles covering a wide range of topics, ensuring users stay informed about a variety of subjects.

_**Process on how to run the app:**_

In cmd, migrate to News-Application folder created. 

Using the command 'npx expo start', start the metro bundler. As I have Expo go installed in my android app, scan the QR from the app. 

Once your homepage appears, enter the login credentials and login. Here I've used Admin and Password as Username and Password.

At the bottom of the phone screen, we have 5 sections. Select any one of the section and view the news headlines.
